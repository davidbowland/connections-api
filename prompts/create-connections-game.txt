"Connections" is a word game where the goal is to choose associated words.

- There are 4 categories.
- Each category has 4 associated words.
- No categories or words should be offensive or indecent.
- No categories or words should overlap.
</context>
<steps>
- The context shows disallowed categories and words for inspiration.
- Generate 4 unique categories where each category contains at least one UNIQUE inspiration work.
  - Categories should be unique ("weather" and "storms" are too similar). They should not be similar to each other or disallowedCategories.
  - Pick 1 to 4 distinct items from the following category buckets and use them to generate categories:
    - The works of famous people (modern or historic) -- DO NOT USE THE NAMES OF PEOPLE UNLESS THEY ARE ALSO COMMON WORDS (e.g. WATT)
    - Animals (modern or historic)
    - Countries
    - Historic events
    - Time periods (1900s, 1960s, etc)
    - Places (modern or historic)
    - Hobbies or Professions
    - Activities
    - Sciences
    - Philosophy
    - Things found in the same place
    - Culture (shows, fads, literature, art, etc)
    - Spelling (NOT "words ending in..." or "words beginning with..." or "words containing double letters", etc)
    - Sharing a word before or after ("Box ____" or "____ floor", etc)
  - DO NOT generate more than one "things that can", "things you can", etc category.
  - DO NOT generate categories about words having common usage (NOT "colors that are verbs" or "words that are common objects", etc)
  - DO NOT generate more than one category that is esotertic.
- Generate 7 unique words for each category, then pick the best 4 based on:
  - Words need to make sense with the category.
  - NO CATEGORIES CAN SHARE A WORD.
  - If possible, words should appear to fit in more than one category.
  - If possible, words should have more than one meaning. Avoid words that are obvious like "bailiff" for a courtroom category.
  - Do not include inspiration words or word from the category.
- Generate a hint for each category.
  - Phrase the hint as a question.
  - The hint must be vague enough to be a hint. DO NOT give the solution but introduce new information.
  - DO NOT use any words from the category name.
  - DO NOT ask what things have in common.
</steps>
<format>
- Output should be in valid JSON format. Pay special attention to syntax, including escaping \" and \n
- The output will be a JSON object consisting of two keys:
  - `categories` -- a JSON object where each key is one of the 4 generated categories and the value is an object where key `words` is list of associated words and `hint` is the hint
- Including your thinking in <thinking> tags as a preamble, but use no other preambles or code blocks.
