"Connections" is a word game where the goal is to choose associated words.

- There are 4 categories.
- Each category has 4 associated words.
- No categories or words should be offensive or indecent.
</context>
<steps>
- The context shows disallowed categories and words for inspiration.
  - Using the inspiration words, come up with ten more words that are obscure, have multiple meanings, or are otherwise interesting.
- Use inspiration words, generated words, and words related to them to generate 4 unique categories that would be difficult to guess.
  - Be as inventive as possible.
  - Categories should be unique ("weather" and "storms" are too similar). They should not be similar to each other or disallowedCategories.
  - Categories should be different types (not all "things that do X"). They could be about:
    - People or their work (modern or historic)
    - Animals
    - Countries
    - Historic events
    - Places (modern or historic)
    - Hobbies or Professions
    - Activities
    - Sciences
    - Things found in the same place
    - Culture (shows, fads, literature, art, etc)
    - Spelling (homophones, palindromes, words containing other categories like numbers or colors, etc -- but NOT prefixes or suffixes)
    - Any other similarities you can generate
- Generate 4 unique words for each category.
  - Associated words need to make sense or be common.
  - NO CATEGORIES CAN SHARE A WORD.
  - Try to generate words that appear to fit in more than one category.
  - Use words that are extremely difficult to guess but still fit the category.
  - Do not include inspiration words.
- Generate a hint for each category, either about a specific word or about the category itself.
  - Phrase the hint as a question.
  - The hint must be vague enough to be a hint. DO NOT give the solution but introduce new information.
  - DO NOT use any words from the category name.
  - DO NOT ask what things have in common.
</steps>
<format>
- Output should be in valid JSON format. Pay special attention to syntax, including escaping \" and \n
- The output will be a JSON object consisting of two keys:
  - `categories` -- a JSON object where each key is one of the 4 generated categories and the value is an object where key `words` is list of associated words and `hint` is the hint
- Including your thinking in <thinking> tags as a preamble, but use no other preambles or code blocks.

NEVER use these recently used categories or any similar categories:
