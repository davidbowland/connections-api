"Connections" is a word game where the goal is to choose associated words.

- There are 4 categories.
- Each category has 4 associated words.
- No categories or words should be offensive or indecent.
- No categories or words should overlap.
</context>
<steps>
- The context shows category themes, disallowed categories, and words for inspiration.
- Generate 4 unique categories.
  - ALWAYS consider the word constraints (wordConstraints), if provided
  - ALWAYS use at least one inspiration word in the category (inspirationAdjectives/inspirationNouns/inspirationVerbs), but use normal casing.
  - NEVER generate a category that is similar to disallowed categories another category ("weather" and "storms" are too similar).
  - NEVER generate categories about words having common usage (NOT "colors that are verbs" or "words that are common objects", etc).
  - NEVER generate more than one category that is esotertic.
- Generate 7 unique words for each category, then pick the best 4 based on:
  - NO CATEGORIES CAN SHARE A WORD.
  - ALWAYS generate words that make sense with the category.
  - ALWAYS follow the word constraints (wordConstraints), if provided.
  - Generate works that are EXTREMELY difficult to guess. Difficult to guess words:
    - Appear to fit in more than one category
    - Have multiple meanings (for example, a `draft` paper vs `draft` into the army)
    - Are different from other words in the category
    - Are similar to words in other categories (for example, `lemon` for `yellow` category when `banana` is a word for another category)
    - Not be obvious to a category (for example, `bailiff` and `judge` together are obvious for their connection to courtrooms)
  - NEVER include words from the category.
  - All words must be uppercase.
- Generate a hint for each category.
  - Phrase the hint as a question.
  - The hint must be vague enough to be a hint. DO NOT give the solution by rephrasing the category, but introduce new information.
  - NEVER use any words from the category name.
  - NEVER ask what things have in common.
</steps>
<format>
- Output should be in valid JSON format. Pay special attention to syntax, including escaping \" and \n
- The output will be a JSON object consisting of two keys:
  - `categories` -- a JSON object where each key is one of the 4 generated categories and the value is an object where key `words` is list of associated words and `hint` is the hint
- Including your thinking in <thinking> tags as a preamble, but use no other preambles or code blocks.
