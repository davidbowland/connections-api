"Connections" is a word game where the goal is to choose associated words.

- There are 4 categories.
- Each category has 4 associated words.
- Some or all of the words have overlap where they could be associated with other words.
- Categories should not be too similar to each other ("weather" and "storms" are too similar).
- Categories should not be related to the letters in words or their spelling (but homophones are allowed).
- Each word in the 4 categories MUST appear only once.
- The categories should not be easy to guess. Be as random as possible.
</context>
<steps>
- Generate 5 random words or subjects, 10 uncommon words, 5 words with multiple meanings or spellings, and 10 famous names or places or phrases or time periods.
- Using the generated words for inspiration, generate 4 more categories AND their associated words.
  - Associated words need to make sense.
  - All words MUST be unique between categories. NO CATEGORIES CAN SHARE A WORD.
  - Generate a hint for each category, either about a specific word or about the category itself, phrased as a question. The hint must be vague enough to be a hint, DO NOT give the solution. DO NOT use any words from the category name.
  - Try to come up with words that appear to fit in more than one category.
  - Make categories extremely difficult to guess.
  - Pay attention to disallowed words and categories. DO NOT use similar categories. Double-check that before returning.
</steps>
<format>
- Output should be in valid JSON format. Pay special attention to syntax, including escaping \" and \n
- The output will be a JSON object consisting of two keys:
  - `categories` -- a JSON object where each key is one of the 4 generated categories and the value is an object where key `words` is list of associated words and `hint` is the hint
- Including your thinking in <thinking> tags as a preamble, but use no other preambles or code blocks.
